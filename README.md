Cogs for [discordrb](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb), in the style of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)'s cog implementation

Cogs allow you to load commands, events, and variables from outside of the main bot file, 
which helps improve organization and readability of code.

#### Note: This gem is in extremely early development. As of now, it is extremely bare bones. More features will be added soon, and everyone is welcome to contribute. Additionally, the code is kinda hacky in some parts, and that will be fixed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cogsdrb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cogsdrb

## Usage

When requiring the gem, you gain access to a few new classes through the `Cogs` module.
 - `Cogs::Cog`
 - `Cogs::BaseBotClass`

`Cogs::BaseBotClass` is a class that inherits from `Discordrb::Commands::CommandBot` and adds the functions necessary
for cogs to be implemented.

Here is a quickstart example:

```ruby
require 'discordrb'
require 'cogsdrb'

bot = Cogs::BaseBotClass.new(token="<token>", prefix="r!")
path_to_cogs = "Path/to/cogs/dir" # Not necessary, but cuts down on repeated values.
# Cogs are loaded by using ruby's `load` keyword to allow updating while the bot runs.
# as such they must be loaded by using a filepath to the ruby file. It's like requiring,
# but you load it with the function `bot.load_extension`.

%w(mod fun).each do |i| # in this example, the path leads to the folder containing `mod.rb` and `fun.rb`
  bot.load_extension(fp="#{path_to_cogs}#{i}")
end

bot.run
```

And here is what `fun.rb` looks like:

```ruby
require 'discordrb'
require 'cogsdrb'

class Fun < Cogs::Cog # Class *must* inherit from `Cogs::Cog`
  def initialize(bot: Discordrb::Commands::CommandBot)
    super(bot) # Required for command registration.
    self.command :hello do |event|
      event.respond "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, #{event.author.mention}!"
    end
  end

  def commands # commands can either be declared in the `initialize` function or a function named `commands`
    self.command :test do |event| # As many commands as you want can be added in either function
      event.respond "Works"
    end
  end
end

def setup(bot)
  bot.add_cog(Fun) # Additionally, all cog files *must* contain this function, or else an error will be thrown and the cog not loaded
end
```

Additionally, Cogs will allow you to manage what cogs are currently "loaded" on your bot. Here are come example commands for managing cogs.
```ruby
self.command :unload do |event, cogname|
  begin
    @bot.unload_cog(cogname: cogname)
    event.respond "Unloaded cog #{cogname}!"
  rescue Cogs::CogError
    event.respond "Whoops! Cog #{cogname} either doesn't exist or is already unloaded! Did you spell it right?"
  end
end

self.command :load do |event, cogname|
  begin
    @bot.reload_cog(cogname)
    event.respond "Loaded cog #{cogname}!"
  rescue Cogs::CogError
    event.respond "Whoops! Cog #{cogname} doesn't exist! Did you spell it correctly?"
  end
end
```

"Unloading" a cog removes all commands categorized in the cog from the bot. "Reloading" allows you to apply updates to
the bot without terminating the process, as the cog file can be edited and reloaded without terminating
the bot process.

Support for events will come in the near future.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
